Have you ever struggled with low charge capacity of your laptop battery and always fear that the adapter shouldn't get unplugged to keep the system running. Well I know how that feels like, that's why I developed this software which keeps an eye over the status whether the adapter is plugged or not.  
Just start the software and after a click of a button you don't have to worry and look out every time. This software warn the user whenever their adapter get unplugged.  
Some key features :-  
1. Start monitoring after launching the application automatically.  
2. Give a sound alert with the visual alert (Visual alert is always enabled).  
3. Hibernate system after a certain time if adapter stays unplugged.  
4. Warning box always stays on top so that you never miss any warning.  
5. Warning won't get off until you plug back adapter in (the warning also goes off if you stop the application).  
6. Warning goes off after you plug in adapter.  
7. It does have some hidden surprises go find them out.
